Project 1: Build a To-do List App.

This project will be the main script in which I will be working as part 1 of the Python certification. As I advance in the course, I will be making edits to this file.
 
The app will let the user visualize the items on the list, as well as add, edit and, complete items. 

WHAT I'VE LEARNED...
1. Storing items on text files.
2. Custom functions to help avoid repititive coding.
3. Anticipating program Errors.
4. Optimizing the code.
